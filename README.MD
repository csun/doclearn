A research project created during the summer of 2016.

The idea was to create something that could learn to identify correlations between natural language phrases and python source code. The performance of the project is not very good, but I've developed a better understanding of the sort of things that I'm interested in learning about, as well as certain topics in NLP.

To run this stuff yourself, `pip install -r requirements.txt`, then `python install_model_data.py`. This should get you all set up to run with python 2.7.x. From there you can use the `train_classifier.py` and `test_classifier.py` scripts to test and train the model.

Warning: A lot of the code in this project was written under a deadline, and is therefore very sloppy. There are probably plenty of bugs.
